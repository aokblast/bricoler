Todo:
- Task for running ZFS test suite, persistent devvm
- man page
- Nicer formatting for "-s".
- Figure out a saner system for importing C functions.
- Figure out a saner syntax for running subtasks than "self.foo = self.foo:run()" 
- Implement some kind of lockfile-based mutual exclusion.
- Add some kind of tmux integration.

Longer-term questions/tasks:
- Add a timeout to the syzkaller task.
- mkimg can be made much faster on systems with block cloning, but this
  requires some work.
- Want some way to avoid needless work when inputs don't change.

Notes for the talk:
- Want to demo plain VM booting+ssh/gdb
- Want to demo stabweek branch
- Mention future plans
  - lua-language-server in ports
