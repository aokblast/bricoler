This is a utility for running FreeBSD src development workflows.  It is still
in its infancy and its interfaces will change.

The basic idea is to simplify common src development tasks by provding a light
framework to wrap operations like:
- building a FreeBSD src tree
- constructing a VM image from the output of a build
- booting the VM image (using QEMU or bhyve)
- running things in the guest once it has booted.

For example, to run the FreeBSD regression test suite against an existing clone
of the FreeBSD src tree, run:

  $ bricoler run freebsd-src-regression-suite-run -p freebsd-src:url=/path/to/clone

Add "--show" to list the available parameters.  Run "bricoler run" without any
other arguments to list available tasks.

== Compatibility ==

This project only runs on FreeBSD.  It is written in Lua as part of an experiment
to try and build up a set of libraries exposing low-level interfaces in FreeBSD,
starting with system calls and eventually up to higher-level components like
pf, jails, bhyve, ZFS, etc..  This makes cross-platform support difficult.  If
it becomes tempting to run bricoler on other platforms, a rewrite in Python or
similar would likely be necessary.

== Building ==

It requires Lua 5.4 and cmake.

To build it, run "make" from the root directory.
